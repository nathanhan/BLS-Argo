##Code style##
#####General#####
*   Indentation is 4 spaces no tabs.
*   Try to make sure all lines span under 80 columns. Try.
*   Don't abbreviate variable and function names unless obvious, like ```src```.

#####Python#####
*   ```'Single quotes'``` for strings used within program. ```"Double quotes"``` for text displayed to humans.
*   Use ```snake_case``` instead of ```camelCase```.
*   Add spaces between operators. Use ```i = i + 1``` instead of ```i=i+1```.
*   Make function definitions ```def foo(arg1, arg2)``` instead of ```def foo ( arg1, arg2 )```. Too much space.

#####HTML#####
*   Use ```this-format``` for id, class, etc.
*   Don't put spaces between operators. Use ```id="sample-id"``` instead of ```id = "sample-id"```.

#####CSS#####
*   Start opening curly braces ```{``` on the same line, not the next line.
